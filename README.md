# 🎵 Analysis of Sentimental Evolution of Spotify User Reviews

## 📌 Project Overview
In an increasingly dynamic digital landscape, understanding how customer sentiment evolves over time has become crucial for driving retention and revenue growth.  
Traditional sentiment analysis methods often treat customer reviews as isolated events, overlooking **temporal patterns** that reflect shifting perceptions and behaviors.  
This oversight can delay the detection of early warning signs (like churn risk) or cause missed opportunities to capitalize on emerging positive trends.

This project bridges that gap by **tracking and forecasting sentiment dynamics among Spotify users**.  
By analyzing textual reviews and engagement metrics over time, we aim to reveal patterns that signal behavioral changes, enabling timely and targeted interventions.  
This temporal approach to sentiment analysis offers Spotify a more nuanced understanding of customer experience to proactively enhance satisfaction, loyalty, and strategic decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Model sentiment as a time series:  
  > S(t) = { s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ } where sᵢ ∈ ℝ  
  > extracted from reviews or engagement metrics at time points t ∈ { t₁, t₂, ..., T }
- **Identify temporal trends and patterns** in S(t).
- **Forecast future sentiment values**, S(t+h) for a horizon h > 0.
- Support Spotify’s retention and revenue strategies through data-driven insights.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- Extract sentiment scores using transformer-based NLP models (e.g., RoBERTa).
- Organize these scores as a time series indexed by review dates.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends.
- Build and evaluate forecasting models such as:
  - Moving Average, ARIMA
  - LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU (deep learning)
- Visualize predictions to interpret upcoming sentiment shifts.

## 💡 Future Work
- Incorporate additional user engagement metrics (skips, likes, shares) for richer sentiment modeling.
- Deploy as a dashboard (e.g., with Streamlit) for real-time monitoring.
- Explore causality links with marketing campaigns or product updates.
